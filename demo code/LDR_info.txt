Specification:
 
1. Photosensitive resistance module's most sensitive to ambient light, commonly used to detect environment around the
brightness of the light, or MCU trigger relay module, etc.;
2. Module in the environment light intensity than set threshold, output high level DO end, when the environment light
intensity more than set threshold, the DO output low level;
3. The DO output can be directly connected to the microcontroller, through single-chip microcomputer to detect
the high and low level, thus to detect the environment light intensity change;
4. The DO output can be directly driven by our relay module, which can form a light-operated switch.

Feature:

1. Using a photosensitive resistance sensor sensitive type;
2. Working Voltage: 3.5V-5V;
3. Output form: Digital Switch show (0 and 1);
4. Fixed Bolt Hole, easy installation;
5. Small PCB size: 3.2CM*1.7CM;
6. The comparator output, signal clean, good waveform, driving ability is strong, for more than 15 ma;
7. With adjustable potentiometer to adjust light brightness;
